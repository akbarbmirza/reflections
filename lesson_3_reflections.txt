Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A: I would want to use a remote repository when I'd like to easily share my work
with some of my collaborators, or even make my work public (open-source or what
have you). Furthermore, remote repositories would also be a great solution to
keep my work backed up. If my local machine bursts into flames and I lose my
files, I can always just get it by cloning my GitHub repository.
